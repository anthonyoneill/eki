# Eki
Eki (Japanese for liquid/solution/fluid) is a solver for transient fluid flow in networks of pipes 
and other components.  

## TODO
 
- [ ] Steady tests ( Drive / Flite Software Shared Docs / FluidFlow QA and Examples / QA Incompressible  ) -> key examples
- [ ] Transient tests + validation
- [ ] Use in PiNTS
- [ ] Use in fluidity
