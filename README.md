# Eki
Eki (Japanese for liquid/solution/fluid) is a solver for transient fluid flow in networks of pipes 
and other components.  

## TODO

- [ ] More thorough steady tests including valves 
- [ ] Convert time_step to use initial_network and new_network (to store the transient solution)
- [ ] Convert solve_transient to use time_step and a specfied number of steps before outputting solution
- [ ] Transient tests + validation
- [ ] Use in PiNTS
- [ ] Use in fluidity
