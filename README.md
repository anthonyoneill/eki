# Eki
Eki (Japanese for liquid/solution/fluid) is a solver for transient fluid flow in networks of pipes 
and other components.  

## TODO

- [ ] Steady tests ( Drive / Flite Software Shared Docs / FluidFlow QA and Examples / QA Incompressible  ) -> key examples
    - [x] Three reservoir problem
    - [x] Single pipe (look at Reynolds number etc)
    - [x] Valve 
    - [ ] Pump
- [ ] Transient tests + validation
    - [x] Streeter & Wylie example
    - [ ] Wood & Lingreddy example ?
- [ ] Use in PiNTS
- [ ] Use in fluidity
